ðŸš€ Top 10 Machine Learning Algorithms You Should Know! ðŸš€

Hello Data Enthusiasts! 

âžž Today, let's quickly explore the most popular Machine Learning algorithms. 

âžž Here's a one-liner for each to get you started! 

1. Linear Regression: 
 â†³ Predicts a continuous dependent variable based on the linear relationship with one or more independent variables.

2. Logistic Regression: 
 â†³ Used for binary classification problems by modeling the probability of a class.

3. Decision Trees: 
 â†³ A tree-like model used for both classification and regression tasks.

4. Random Forest:
 â†³ An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.

5. Support Vector Machines (SVM): 
 â†³ Finds the optimal hyperplane that best separates classes in a dataset.

6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): 
 â†³ Classifies data points based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors.

7. K-Means Clustering: 
 â†³ Groups data points into k clusters based on their features.

8. Naive Bayes: 
 â†³ A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption of feature independence.

9. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): 
 â†³ An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially to correct errors of previous models.

10. Neural Networks: 
 â†³ Models complex patterns in data through layers of interconnected nodes (neurons).
